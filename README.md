# TorrentUploader

TorrentUploader is a simple utility that allows you to upload **.torrent** files or 
**magnet** links to a headless uTorrent server from a remote client with a single click 
without logging into the WebUI Management console. It does this by associating itself
with .torrent files and magnet links on the client machine and then using the uTorrent 
API to start the download of the torrent contents on the server machine.

# TorrentUploader

TorrentUploader is a simple utility that allows you to upload **.torrent** files or 
**magnet** links to a headless uTorrent server from a remote client with a single click 
without logging into the WebUI Management console. It does this by associating itself
.torrent files and magnet links and then using the uTorrent API to start the downloading
of the torrent contents.
